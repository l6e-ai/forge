Forge (l6e-forge) is an open source toolkit for building and shipping local-first AI agents. It provides an optional full stack—API, monitoring, chat UI—and an adapters-first, extensible architecture so you can swap components (runners, memory, databases, models) without lock‑in. Learn more on our docs site.
